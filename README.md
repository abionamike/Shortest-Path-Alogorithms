# Shortest Path Algorithms

Algorithms to determine the shoartest path between a source and destination. This project to provide insight to which algorithm will be best for use in a navigation system. It is to answer the question of which alogorithm will run fastest and within the shortest time.


## Usage

**1. Ensure Python programming lanuage is installed on your machine else download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).**

**2. Clone this project**

```
$  git clone https://github.com/abionamike/shortest-path-algorithms.git
```

Then, Enter the project

```
$  cd shortest-path-algorithms
```

**3. Run the algorithm from the file**<br/>
Command for windows users:
   ```
   $ python [filename]
   ```
Command for Mac users:
   ```
   $ python3 [filename]
   ```
   
**5. The commands are ran for 5 to 10 iterations and the average runtime is noted for each algorithm**

**5. The algorithm with the shortest runtime will give answer to algorithm is the fastest**

**7. A table is generated from the data gotten and graphs and charts are plotted for visualizations of the data for each algorithm**
